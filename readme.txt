This plugin adds an admin panel notice showing whether or not your website can be indexed by search engines. 

== Description ==

If your WordPress site is not being indexed by search engines you should know. This will display an admin notice with a very clear message indicating whether or not your header has a robots nofollow tag in it. No surprises if your website traffic was dropping by accident because you had a no follow tag, or if your website was getting indexed when you didn't want it to be. 
 

Major features in WP Check Indexable include:

* No setup required!
* Piece of mind knowing your site can or can't be indexed.

== Installation ==

Upload the wp-check-indexable folder to your wp-content/plugins directory, then Activate it. No configuration needed.
